					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I have an Irish background and lived there until the age of 5 when I moved to Australia to start primary school. From there I completed high school and a TAFE course in community services. I speak some Gaelic which I learnt from my dad who immigrated to Australia when he was 32, I can also speak sign language which I learnt through my job as a support worker, and am learning Japanese. I love to travel and experience new things so something interesting about me is that I hope to one day be able to travel to every country in the world.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I find it super interesting how IT is everchanging and evolving in that there will always be something new to invent or figure out. Specifically, I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect and how you can use different ways of thinking to solve problems, I think this really challenges me and this is why I have chosen to study IT. My interest in IT started when my mum enrolled me in holiday coding classes from a young age, I eventually learned the basics and once I became a teenager began teaching at the holiday classes I used to attend. Although it was all basic coding of games and robots it really gave me a sense of how fun and diverse programming can be.</p>

			<h1>Why I chose to study at RMIT</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>I chose to study through OUA at RMIT because it was a very flexible option that worked with my schedule as I work full-time as a support worker. I also didn’t get an ATAR in year 12, so I needed to look at other options that would allow me a pathway into studying computer science or software engineering at university. After a lot of research, I found you can do two individual subjects on OUA and use these as a pathway to enter a degree, which is what I hope to achieve.</p>

			<h1>What I expect to learn from my studies</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>One tangible skill that I hope to receive throughout my studies is a deeper understanding into AI and machine learning, this is an area that really interests me and I’d like to learn more about it so I can start to understand the skills I will have to gain to work in that area. I would also like to become confident in coding in basic languages such as python to have some solid foundations to build my programming knowledge from.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Software Engineer - Machine Learning</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The job description describes the position of a machine learning engineer, this is someone who programs and delivers the product based on the model that has been designed. ML engineers build an artificial intelligence system that uses data sets and develops algorithms that will eventually be capable of learning and making predictions. This is appealing to me as I think AI constantly pushes you to use new and different ways of thinking, which is therefore constantly improving you as an engineer.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>The programming skills I currently have are quite limited, I’ve learned the basics of coding in python and I have the foundational knowledge of how to code games and simple command robots. However, I am currently completing the introduction to programming course, and my other skills are patience, good time management skills, and include strong communication skills which will be beneficial to me in my learning.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>For this job it is required that you have proficiency in the language of either Python or Scala, other preferred skills include experience with cloud platforms, familiarity with spark, and familiarity with one of the machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or Scikit-Learn.
There are no qualifications stated as requirements for this job however they do require experience of at least one year of software development.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>To obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience for this role I would start in my first year by
gaining background knowledge in the subject by doing AI online training with linked-in learning. In my second year, I plan to try one of the free online courses by google like “Learn with google AI” or “Google - machine learning.” In my third year, I will start applying to internships in the AI and machine learning sector. After I graduate I would start applying to graduate/entry-level positions so I could gain the one year of professional programming experience required for this role.

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Personality Profile results</h2>
					<p>The Myers-Briggs result I got was the turbulent mediator, INFP-T. However, after reading the descriptions I personally think I am more of an assertive mediator. The mediator explains my personality well as more of a watcher who likes to listen and think rather than say. Although the values of a mediator relate to me I would say I am more pragmatic and determined than this profile illustrates. For my learning style test, I found out I have the theorists learning style, to me this explains how I really like to analyse and understand the work before I do it, I have a very logical and detail-oriented way of thinking and I think this is reflected in my learning style. My leadership style was the frontline leader which to me reflects emotional intelligence and how important it is to have empathy as a leader and to inspire and empower the people around you.</p>
					<h3>How I think this influcences my behavior in a team</h3>
					<p>Overall I think my personality type showed that I find it easy to listen, value, and consider other people's ideas and opinions which helps when contributing to groups projects, however, I can sometimes work too logically for people who have different approaches to learning which can sometimes make it difficult to compromise. In the discussion phase I am very open to new ideas and discussions however as the project progresses I usually like to work more methodically and detail oriented in sometimes, quite a perfectionistic manner. In the past, this has caused friction with other group members who prefer to use a more laid-back approach when creating a project. </p>
					<h3>How I take this into account when forming a team</h3>
					<p>The main strategy I like to use when working in a team to avoid some of these problems and achieve a good outcome is communication, I think it’s important to be understanding of other peoples learning styles and not try and hold them to the standard of what makes you comfortable. However, with this being said, I also think it can be beneficial to have people with different learning styles collaborating as it can bring new elements of creativity and detail to the work.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Buddy Hub is an idea for an app using a concept similar to dating apps to connect individuals and groups to form possible new friendships. I think this project would be beneficial to young people in an increasingly fragmented digital society. It will use data and AI to predict the compatibility of possible new friendships based on your existing networks and preferences.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Buddy Hub is an interesting approach to forming new friendships, in a way that has been heavily saturated by dating apps but not applied more generally to helping people form new connections in person. In an increasingly online world, social media and technology have made it easier to stay connected to the people you already know but can in reality isolate us from making new deeper friendships. I believe Buddy Hub could be useful to address the challenge and pressures younger generations are feeling growing up in such a technology-mediated social context. Studies from the headspace national youth mental health survey show that 54% of young Australians feel a sense of loneliness and that 43% percent felt isolated which has only been exasperated by the impact of covid, I believe Buddy Hub would help to address some of these problems.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Buddy Hub will be a mobile app that uses machine learning algorithms paired with artificial intelligence and data systems to create personalised recommendations on friendship compatibility. It would do this using their stated preferences, data collected from other app usage, location data, and personality profiling. It would also have an optional feature where users could connect their social media accounts to give the app access to their existing networks. It could be used by all ages but would be specifically marketed towards young people, who are the demographic most affected by media isolation right now. Some scenarios it might be useful in, include moving cities or countries, starting in a new industry, school or university; or starting a new hobby and looking for friends with similar interests.

 A typical customer experience using Buddy Hub would include an initial intake of basic information in the sign-up process followed by a deeper analysis of the users' personality type, hobbies, interests, and beliefs. They would then be able to create a profile and state what they were looking for, for example, someone could be looking to join a group of friends, looking for a study buddy, or even just someone to talk to. They would then be shown profiles of people who are compatible with their profile and given access to message them through the app.




Possible challenges or setbacks the app might face may be privacy issues, regarding the information shared by the users and who could have access to that information, such as personal data and identifying details. There would also be potential for identity theft, fraud, catfishing, or abusive behavior. To address these problems we would have to use clear and transparent protocols around identity transparency which may include a verification process to keep users traceable and accountable. Another possible obstacle would be that the app relies on a critical mass of users to operate effectively in finding compatible matches. A possible solution to this would be to focus the initial launch and marketing strategy in a confined geographic location which can then spread to other areas once gained popularity and customer confidence.

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The first stage would be to design and build a minimal viable product (MVP) using free open source tools such as Google App Engine and Google Recommendations AI. No specific hardware would be needed at this stage and data would be stored in Google Cloud during the development period. Google App Engine supports apps built in Python and other languages and is a fully managed environment. Google Recommendations AI allows you to build an end to end personalised recommendation system based on machine learning. Sample data could be used for initial testing and prototyping. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>In order to write the application from scratch I would need advanced programming skills in a language such as Python, Ruby, C+ or Java. Another option while I’m learning to code is to use a drag and drop app builder such as Appy Pie or Good Barber that creates HTML-5 hybrid apps that work with all platforms. While I am designing and prototyping the app I could learn to use tools such as InVision or AdobbeXD to create an interactive screen prototype to test with the target demographic. I would need to develop additional skills and knowledge in how to set up and integrate a machine learning system using Google Recommendations AI. It would also be possible to outsource to a machine learning engineer to build the framework and algorithm for recommendations.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project was successful a positive outcome would result in a high uptake of customers, who are satisfied with the service they have been provided by being connected with new friends they are compatible with. The result of this would be an increase in a sense of belonging and community for the younger generations and therefore a reduction in young people feeling lonely and isolated. The impact of this would be a more positive use of data and social media to bring people together in forming deeper and more meaningful relationships, rather than the current superficial casual connections.</p>
